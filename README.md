1. Introduction
   
This proposal outlines the implementation of a comprehensive Fraud Detection System utilizing AWS cloud services. The solution is designed to detect and respond to potentially fraudulent user registration events in real time while maintaining a detailed audit trail and providing operational visibility for security and compliance purposes.

2. Project Objectives
   
The primary objectives of this project are:
.To proactively identify and mitigate fraudulent registration attempts.
.To provide real-time notifications for high-risk activities.
.To maintain an audit trail of all fraud detection events for analysis and compliance.
.To build a scalable, secure, and serverless infrastructure for fraud detection.

3. System Overview
   
The Fraud Detection System leverages machine learning, event-driven processing, and cloud-native services to assess user registration events for suspicious patterns. It integrates real-time risk assessment, alerting mechanisms, data persistence, and API-based interaction through a serverless, scalable architecture.

5. Key Components

4.1 Fraud Detection Engine
Amazon Fraud Detector is configured with a custom model (group3_fraud_detector) to evaluate registration events.
Assesses multiple indicators such as IP addresses and email addresses.
Returns risk outcomes which are processed to identify high-risk events.

4.2 Alerting System
Amazon SNS sends real-time notifications for high-risk detection events.
Configurable keywords (e.g., "high_risk", "fraudulent") act as alert triggers.
Email subscriptions notify the security team immediately upon detection.
A debug mode (SNS_PUBLISH) allows safe testing of the notification workflow.

4.3 Data Persistence
Amazon DynamoDB securely stores all fraud detection events and corresponding outcomes.
Maintains a timestamped audit trail for compliance and operational analysis.

4.4 API Interface
A RESTful API built using API Gateway enables clients to submit fraud check requests.
Exposes a POST /predict endpoint.
Fully CORS-enabled to allow secure, cross-origin requests.

5. Technical Architecture
6. 
The system follows a serverless architecture utilizing the following AWS services:
Component	Service	Purpose
Core Logic	AWS Lambda	Executes fraud detection workflow
Fraud Prediction	Amazon Fraud Detector	Provides ML-based fraud risk assessments
Notification Service	Amazon SNS	Delivers real-time alerts
Data Storage	Amazon DynamoDB	Records detection events and audit logs
API Management	Amazon API Gateway	Manages secure, scalable API access

6. Key Features
 
Real-Time Risk Assessment: Immediate evaluation of each registration event upon submission.
Flexible Alerting: Customizable risk thresholds and alerting rules.
Audit Logging: Comprehensive, timestamped records for each detection event.
Scalability: Serverless infrastructure automatically scales based on incoming demand.
Security: IAM role-based permissions and policies enforce fine-grained access control.

7. Use Cases

This solution addresses a range of practical fraud prevention scenarios:
Detecting fraudulent new user registrations.
Preventing account takeovers.
Monitoring suspicious user behavior.
Generating compliance reports for fraud-related incidents.

8. Deployment Strategy

The system is deployed using AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM), leveraging Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) principles. This approach ensures:
Reliable and repeatable provisioning.
Version-controlled infrastructure.
Automated deployment pipelines.

9. Monitoring and Maintenance

All system components are integrated with AWS CloudWatch, enabling:
Real-time operational monitoring.
Centralized logging for fraud detection outcomes and alerts.
Health and error metrics for system components.
Alert delivery tracking.

10. Conclusion

This Fraud Detection System delivers a secure, scalable, and efficient solution for identifying and managing potentially fraudulent user registration events. By combining AWS-managed services with machine learning-powered detection, real-time notifications, and detailed audit logging, the system ensures proactive protection, operational visibility, and compliance readiness for security operations teams.
