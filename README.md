Fraud Detection System - Project Description
Overview
This project implements a comprehensive fraud detection system using AWS services to analyze registration events for potential fraudulent activity. The solution combines machine learning-powered fraud detection with real-time alerting and audit logging capabilities.

Key Components
1. Fraud Detection Engine
Utilizes Amazon Fraud Detector with a custom model (group3_fraud_detector) to evaluate registration events

Analyzes key indicators like IP addresses and email addresses for suspicious patterns

Returns multiple risk outcomes that are processed for high-risk indicators

2. Alerting System
Amazon SNS for real-time notifications when high-risk events are detected

Configurable high-risk keywords that trigger alerts (e.g., "high_risk", "fraudulent")

Email subscription for security team notifications

Debug mode available for testing (SNS_PUBLISH)

3. Data Persistence
Amazon DynamoDB table for storing all fraud detection events and outcomes

Complete audit trail with timestamps for compliance and analysis

4. API Interface
API Gateway endpoint for submitting fraud check requests

RESTful POST endpoint at /predict

CORS-enabled for cross-origin access

Technical Architecture

The system follows a serverless architecture with these key AWS services:

AWS Lambda for the core fraud detection logic

Amazon Fraud Detector for machine learning-based predictions

Amazon SNS for alert distribution

Amazon DynamoDB for event logging

API Gateway for secure API access

Key Features
Real-time Risk Assessment: Immediate evaluation of registration events

Flexible Alerting: Configurable risk thresholds and notification channels

Audit Trail: Comprehensive logging of all detection events

Scalable: Serverless architecture automatically scales with demand

Secure: IAM role-based permissions for all components

Use Cases:
New user registration fraud detection

Account takeover prevention

Suspicious activity monitoring

Compliance reporting for fraud events

Deployment:
The system is deployed using AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) with infrastructure-as-code for reliable and repeatable provisioning.

Monitoring:
All components integrate with AWS CloudWatch for logging and monitoring, providing visibility into:

API request volumes

Fraud detection outcomes

Alert delivery status

System errors
